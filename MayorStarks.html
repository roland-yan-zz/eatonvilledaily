          <h2 class="section-heading">A Man Of The People</h2>

          <p>Has Joe Starks lost his touch? </p>

          <p>No one can argue that he made this town. That it was his confidence, money, and leadership that tripled our size, doubled our population, and made us the envy of Orange County.</p>

          <p>But he wasn’t just a leader; he was a man who you could talk to. Someone you could share a beer with over a game of checkers. He was a brother, a father, and a friend.</p>

          <p>He shared our dreams and was one of us.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">People Change</h2>

          <p>However, the Mayor Starks of now is not the Joe we once admired. In fact, it almost seems as if he is intentionally distancing himself from the rest of the town. </p>

          <p>With his new two-story house with porches, banisters, and painted with a gloaty promenading white, the rest of the town looks like servants’ quarters surrounding the “big house.” Speaking with him is unnerving as he stares down at you through his lit cigar from his fancy desk, both him and his wife spitting into expensive spittoons.</p>

          <p>He is the Mayor, the postmaster, a landlord, and the storekeeper, and he makes it known</p>

          <p>“Our beloved Mayor” is no longer genuinely beloved.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Something New</h2>

          <p>Maybe it is time for a new mayor.</p>

          <p>Someone from the people. Someone with the same ambition now that Joe had when he first came.</p>

          <p>When Joe first installed the lights, he called the people to a vote. I wish to call us together again for another vote. </p>

          <p>Is Mayor Starks still the same man we elected all those years ago, or is it time for someone new? </p>
