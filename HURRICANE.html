          <h2 class="section-heading">A Great Loss.</h2>

          <p>Weather stations are reporting a massive Hurricane will be hitting the Florida Coast and Everglades in the following week, strengthened by the summer trade winds and coastal currents. </p>

          <p> It is suspected to be a buildup from Ocean Typhoons and will be accompanied by heavy rains and strong lightning and thunder. 
          </p>

          <p>The Hurricane will be moving Northeast and heading up the east coast, reaching as far as Lower New Jersey before finally splitting off to dissipate in the Atlantic. The winds are estimated to reach around 128 miles per hour and will be ranked around a Category 3, which is ranked to have devastating damage. 
          </p>

          <p>In addition, it is noted that the Everglades will be particularly hard hit, as it will take the immediate and strongest front of the Hurricane as it emerges, fresh from the Ocean. Its marsh-like environment will only threaten it further, as an elevated water-table will no doubt ensure catastrophic flooding and slowed travel away from the area. </p>

          <p>Engineers also warn that the Dikes WILL NOT be able to withstand the flooding, and it is certain it will overflow. The dam also has a chance of breaking under years of structural strain, but evacuation efforts should shelter in higher grand where even an overflow should not reach. However, all those remaining in the valley will be overwhelmed by extreme flooding. 
          </p>

          <p>EMERGENCY SERVICES will be temporarily suspended during the overflow, and medical personnel will not be able to reach the affected area until the next day. 
          </p>

          <p> It is advised that all people from directly affected locations LEAVE THE AREA and nearby regions (such as Eatonville) SHELTER IN PLACE. </p>
